*Google Chrome but every time you load a page Barry B Benson asks 'You like jazz?'*

*Update: The extension has been taken down from the web store due to copyright violation of the name "Chrome." TBD on whether it will be re-published, but honestly I don't want to inflict this pain on any more people*
